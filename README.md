# 3D-printer-model-and-simulation

This project is an attemp to simulate the working of an extrusion 3D printer, The 3D model is made using fusion 360. 
The working, Inverse kinematics of the 3D printer(which is similar to a 3DOF cartision manipulator) are computed using MATLAB. 
A 3D plot of the robot is also plotted using matlab lab to understand the working of the code and check its correctness
